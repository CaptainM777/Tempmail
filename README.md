# Temp-Bot: A Modmail Bot for the [Bee and Puppycat Server](https://discord.gg/2nJ9Nf9GjE)
This bot uses [Dragory's modmail bot](https://github.com/Dragory/modmailbot) as its base. 

Some of the code was changed around to accomodate one server, so if you want to use it for multiple servers, you'll run into problems. This project was made open source for the sake of viewing and not really for ease of use. If you want to modify the code I wrote, feel free to do so!
